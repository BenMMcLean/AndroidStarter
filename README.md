# AndroidStarter
A basic template repository for bootstrapping a new Android application with a fully integrated build workflow.

## How to use
Clone this repository and copy `/project/` into your repository. Then find and replace for "cl.benm.application" with your
own package name, and "Application" with your application name. Following this, select and specialise the most relevant
workflows from the `/workflows/` folder and paste them into `/project/.github/workflows/`.
